# UCSDcellTrack
## Steps of running:
1. Establish a set of parameters that works for the set(s) to be tracked using the GUI, and save in the "Parameters" folder.
2. Publish a Google Spreadsheet like mine and put the link in the "locations.mat" file. The essential column headings are in blue (the spreadsheet is parsed by these headings, so yours need to match mine exactly).
3. Run the command (e.g.) runID(1:4) to track and measure the first 4 entries of your spreadsheet.
